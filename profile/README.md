# Building the Future of Drone2Data To Fight Climate Change and Food Security

## Mapping real-world maps made easy



Climate Change is perhaps the biggest threat facing humanity today. Climate Change creates a drier and hotter climate leading to wildfires that could further accelerate Climate Change. This forms a perfect positive feedback loop that could shrink our time to address the looming climate crisis. An early fire detection system aimed at detecting fire in the most inaccessible areas could be an important tool in this battle against climate change. Project Themistoklis aims to make it easy for anyone to map the real world using drones that could form the basis for many climate solutions. 



We aim to use drones to capture the real world using cameras and other sensors. The captured data can be used to detect wildfire, survey biodiversity, monitor forest health, and provide valuable information that was once inaccessible. This drone2data tech stack we are developing will be as important in addressing food security when deployed at farms as it will be in addressing climate change.



### Use cases

To detect wildfires in inaccessible locations using AI fire detection models
To survey forests to study biodiversity and other forest health-related parameters
To monitor the health of food crops on large farms using AI models
